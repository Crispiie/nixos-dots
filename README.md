    This is my NixOS configuration using the Cattpuccin Mocha theme
    
    Before installing to-do list 
        * change your user from crispi to <USER>
        * comment out hard-drive, river, nvidia (if you do not use a Nvidia GPU), and whatever pkgs you would not like
        * remove hardware-configuration.nix and place your own inside

                                ENJOY!
